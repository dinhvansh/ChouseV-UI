/**
 * Navigation access — single source of truth for which RBAC permissions unlock
 * each top-level area and its tabs.
 *
 * The page route guard (AdminRoute), the nav (FloatingDock), the default-landing
 * redirect (DefaultRedirect), and the in-page tab gating (Admin) all derive from
 * these constants. Keeping them in one place prevents the lists from drifting:
 * historically the Admin lists were duplicated and fell out of sync, so a user
 * holding e.g. only `sso:view` or `connections:view` was bounced from /admin even
 * though they had a tab they were allowed to see.
 *
 * Rule: having ANY one of an area's permissions reveals that area (its route, its
 * nav entry) and every tab the user individually qualifies for.
